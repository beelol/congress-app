## Directions

You may search for congressmembers by typing into the top left search bar.
To the right of the search bar, there is a filter selection box to display members of only a specified state.
To the right of that selection box is another to display members only within a certain party.
Finally, to sort by specific properties, including a member's name, party, number of terms served, and state, the bar at the very top right will allow you to choose from one of the former options.
